## Background

This repo contains starter code for building Tableland clients. It contains a basic example using the Tableland SDK ([`@tableland/js-tableland)`](https://github.com/tablelandnetwork/js-tableland)) for creating, writing to, and reading a table as well as Local Tableland ([@tableland/local](https://github.com/tablelandnetwork/local-tableland)) support during development. Both linting (with [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/)) and code formatting (with [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/)) are also included.

## Usage

First, clone this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tablelandnetwork/js-template
```

To get started, run `npm install` and then `npm run build` command; this will compile the package to the `dist` directory. In `src/index.ts`, there is a basic example of the aforementioned database functionality. A table is created, written to with a single value `hello`, and then exports this value after reading it from the table.

## Development

Use the command `npm run up`, which runs `npm install`, the `build` command, and then spins up a Local Tableland node (the `lt` command). You can then use the output files in the `dist` directory against a local-only Tableland network.

This project also comes with [`mocha`](https://mochajs.org/) and tests already set up. Running `npm test` will spin up a local node (see: `test/setup.ts`), run the tests against the Local Tableland network, and then shut down the local node upon test completion. Coverage tests with [`c8`](https://github.com/bcoe/c8) are also included, and can be run with `npm run coverage` command to output a coverage report to the `coverage` directory.

There are also a few other commands you can use:

- `npm run lint`: Lint the codebase with `eslint` (along with the `lint:fix` option).
- `npm run prettier`: Prettify the code format with `prettier` (along with the `prettier:fix` option).
- `npm run format`: Both lint and format the codebase with `eslint` and `prettier`, also fixing any issues it can.
- `npm run clean`: Remove the `dist` and `coverage` folders.
